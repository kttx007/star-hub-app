## Quick Start

Install the skill with a repository-aware skills installer:

```bash
npx skills add jomeswang/agnes-ai-skill -g
```

Or copy this sentence to your agent:

```text
Please read and install Agnes AI Skill: https://github.com/jomeswang/agnes-ai-skill
```

After installation, create an Agnes API key at
[platform.agnes-ai.com/settings/apiKeys](https://platform.agnes-ai.com/settings/apiKeys)
and configure it as `AGNES_API_KEY`. Then tell the agent `generate an image`,
`generate a video`, `edit this image`, or `integrate Agnes API`, and it can
choose the proper Agnes model and execution path automatically.

This skill helps agents:

- set up Agnes AI and persist an `AGNES_API_KEY`
- use `agnes-2.0-flash` for chat, coding, streaming, and tool calling
- use `agnes-image-2.0-flash` and `agnes-image-2.1-flash` for AI image
  generation, image editing, and image-to-image workflows
- use `agnes-video-v2.0` for text-to-video, image-to-video, and async video
  generation
- prefer the companion `agnes-ai-cli` for live requests

Compatible tools: Codex, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, OpenClaw, Hermes,
WorkBuddy, Cherry Studio, Opencode, Kimi Work, and other Agent Skills /
SKILL.md-compatible environments.

## Important Announcement

**Agnes 2.0 full-modal model APIs are officially open for free global calls.**

- No fixed end date, full-modal access, and free API calls within RPM 20
- Register on the official platform, create a key, and call directly
- Text, image, and video are all supported
- Models keep upgrading while free access is maintained

**Official platform:** https://platform.agnes-ai.com

> The live official model docs also include pricing sections. For cost, quota,
> or commercial use, check the current official docs first.

This repository packages a single root `SKILL.md` so coding agents can quickly:

- get and persist an Agnes API key
- use `agnes-2.0-flash` for chat, coding, streaming, and tool calling
- use `agnes-image-2.0-flash` and `agnes-image-2.1-flash` for image generation
  and editing
- use `agnes-video-v2.0` for asynchronous video generation and polling

It is designed for the exact pitch that makes Agnes easy to try:

- one provider for text, image, and video
- public free-access positioning that lowers experimentation friction
- agent, creative, and prototyping workflows where repeated calls matter

The skill stays intentionally lightweight. It teaches agents how to make Agnes
API calls successfully without copying the full docs into the repository.

## Install

With a repository-aware skills installer:

```bash
npx skills add jomeswang/agnes-ai-skill -g
```

Because this repository uses a single root `SKILL.md`, installers that support
repository-root skills can discover it directly.

### Verified Install Path

This repository has been validated with:

```bash
npx skills add jomeswang/agnes-ai-skill --list
npx skills add jomeswang/agnes-ai-skill --agent codex --yes
```

The repository is discoverable as a single root-level skill named
`agnes-ai-skill`.

## Companion CLI

The published companion execution layer is:

- npm: [`agnes-ai-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agnes-ai-cli)
- GitHub: [`jomeswang/agnes-ai-cli`](https://github.com/jomeswang/agnes-ai-cli)

Install it when you want stable commands instead of hand-written requests:

```bash
npm install -g agnes-ai-cli
agnes --help
```

## Model Guide

Use the repository skill with these defaults:

- `agnes-2.0-flash`
  - chat, coding, streaming, tool calling, and agent workflows
  - default when `text chat` runs without `--model`
- `agnes-image-2.1-flash`
  - default for new text-to-image and image-to-image work
  - strongest fit for denser layouts, richer detail, and better semantic
    alignment
  - default when `image text2img`, `image img2img`, or `image compose` runs
    without `--model`
- `agnes-image-2.0-flash`
  - better when you explicitly need its documented `tags: ["img2img"]` flow,
    multi-image composition, or `seed`-based reproducibility
- `agnes-video-v2.0`
  - text-to-video, image-to-video, multi-image guided video, keyframes, and
    asynchronous polling
  - current default when any `video` generate command runs without `--model`

The official docs also give each model fairly different best practices:

- Image 2.1 leans into high-information-density visuals and composition
  preservation
- Image 2.0 is more explicit about edit/composition workflows, response fields,
  and OpenAI Images-style compatibility
- Video 2.0 is task-based and documents multiple generation modes, task states,
  result polling, and frame-count constraints

## Showcase

The strongest outside prompt libraries all do the same three things well:
lead with a preview, keep the prompt compact enough to scan, and organize
examples by outcome instead of by raw API parameter lists. This gallery follows
that pattern with 9 compact cases regenerated with Agnes on June 1, 2026. The
image prompts were tightened toward the shorter, more editorial style seen in
`awesome-gpt-image-2`, the video prompts were rebuilt around ad-film,
animation, and cinematic beats inspired by `awesome-seedance`, and the HTML
cases were regenerated as brighter, more public-facing product experiences.

## Why Agnes

Agnes is most interesting when one workflow needs all three layers together:

- text for planning, coding, prompting, and agent loops
- image for marketing, e-commerce, and creative visual generation
- video for storyboards, product demos, motion tests, and short-form content

The supplied public writeups consistently frame Agnes as useful for:

- rapid AI product prototyping
- high-frequency agent workflows where repeated model calls matter
- frontend or HTML generation
- marketing and e-commerce creatives
- ad, storyboard, and cinematic short-video iteration

This skill turns that platform surface into one reusable installation target for
Codex and other SKILL.md-compatible agents, with guidance that helps the agent
choose the right Agnes model and authenticate cleanly.

## What It Does

- Platform and auth flow from the Agnes quickstart docs
- API key creation via the Agnes platform settings page
- Persistent `AGNES_API_KEY` setup for future sessions
- OpenAI-style request patterns for text and image endpoints
- Asynchronous task workflow for video generation
- Practical use cases reinforced by the supplied public writeups

## Why The Free Angle Matters

- Agnes is unusually compelling when one platform covers text, image, and video
  together.
- The strongest growth hook in its public messaging is not just quality, but
  the promise of lower-cost or broadly free experimentation.
- That matters most for agents, prototypes, content pipelines, and repeated
  A/B-style creative iteration.
- In practice, treat this as a major adoption advantage, while still verifying
  the current live billing terms before promising zero cost.

## Model Quick Reference

| Model | Best for | Endpoint | Required fields | Special fields / caveats |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agnes-2.0-flash` | chat, coding, streaming, tool calling, agent loops | `/v1/chat/completions` | `model`, `messages` | OpenAI-style `tools`, `tool_choice`, `stream` |
| `agnes-image-2.1-flash` | new text-to-image, image-to-image, denser layouts, composition-preserving edits | `/v1/images/generations` | `model`, `prompt` | `size`, `extra_body.image`, `extra_body.response_format`; strongest fit for high-information-density scenes |
| `agnes-image-2.0-flash` | edit-heavy workflows, multi-image composition, compatibility-style image flows | `/v1/images/generations` | `model`, `prompt` | often pair with `tags: ["img2img"]`; supports `seed`, `extra_body.image`, `extra_body.response_format` |
| `agnes-video-v2.0` | text-to-video, image-to-video, multi-image guided video, keyframes | create: `/v1/videos`; poll: `/agnesapi?video_id={video_id}` | `model`, `prompt` | asynchronous task workflow; create returns `taskId` and `videoId`; use `videoId` for polling, while older `taskId` polling remains legacy-compatible |

## Pricing / Operational Caveats

- The official Image 2.0, Image 2.1, and Video 2.0 docs currently include
  pricing sections.
- Some public writeups still frame Agnes as broadly free or indefinitely free.
- The Video 2.0 docs are also operationally time-sensitive: the same page can
  mix concrete price figures with "pricing to be announced" style notes.
- Treat all pricing, free-tier, and billing claims as live-doc verified only.

## Safety Model

- The skill checks for `AGNES_API_KEY` before live requests
- If the key is missing, it points the user to the official Agnes quickstart
  and API key page instead of guessing
- If the user provides a key and wants it remembered, the skill persists
  `AGNES_API_KEY` in the correct shell rc file for future sessions
- Live payloads and response handling stay grounded in Agnes docs and real API
  behavior, not only in marketing copy
